provides a high-level {API} that leverages Spark's rich ecosystem to simplify the

abstract = "This paper deals with the problem of supervised wrapper-based feature subset selection in datasets with a very large number of attributes. Recently the literature has contained numerous references to the use of hybrid selection algorithms: based on a filter ranking, they perform an incremental wrapper selection over that ranking. Though working fine, these methods still have their problems: (1) depending on the complexity of the wrapper search method, the number of wrapper evaluations can still be too large; and (2) they rely on a univariate ranking that does not take into account interaction between the variables already included in the selected subset and the remaining ones. Here we propose a new approach whose main goal is to drastically reduce the number of wrapper evaluations while maintaining good performance (e.g. accuracy and size of the obtained subset). To do this we propose an algorithm that iteratively alternates between filter ranking construction and wrapper feature subset selection (FSS). Thus, the \{FSS\} only uses the first block of ranked attributes and the ranking method uses the current selected subset in order to build a new ranking where this knowledge is considered. The algorithm terminates when no new attribute is selected in the last call to the \{FSS\} algorithm. The main advantage of this approach is that only a few blocks of variables are analyzed, and so the number of wrapper evaluations decreases drastically. The proposed method is tested over eleven high-dimensional datasets (2400–46,000 variables) using different classifiers. The results show an impressive reduction in the number of wrapper evaluations without degrading the quality of the obtained subset. "

abstract="Frequent pattern mining attracts extensive research interests over the past two decades: including mining frequent item sets from transactions, extracting frequent sequences from bio-arrays and detecting common subgraph from molecular structures. In the era of big data, the explosive data volume brings new challenges to frequent pattern mining: (1) Space complexity: both input data, intermediate results and the outputted patterns could be too large to fit into memory which prevents many algorithms from executing; (2) Time complexity: many existing approaches rely on exhaustive search or complicated data structures to mine frequent patterns which prove to be inapplicable for big data. To deal with these two challenges. we propose ISbFIM, an Iterative Sampling based Frequent Itemset Mining method. Rather than process the entire data set at once, ISbFIM samples computationally-manageable subsets and extracts frequent itemsets from these subsets. By repeating this process for a sufficient number of times, we can guarantee both theoretically and empirically that the frequent itemsets can be enumerated without running into a combinatorial explosion. ISbFIM can be easily parallelized and applied to mine item sets, sequences or structures. We implement a Map-Reduce version of ISbFIM to demonstrate its scalability on big data.",
