Frequent Itemset Mining is a set Data Mining techniques used to discover frequently co-occurring itemsets from transactional datasets. In the last years, with the increasing amount of data to process, many scalable Frequent Itemset Mining approaches have been introduced, leveraging the popular frameworks Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark. 
In this experimental comparison, we have compared the performances of the best available state of the art implementations dealing with different types of dataset, in order to support the reader in the choice of the most suitable approach depending on the characteristics of his specific problem. The review covers also the analysis of two real life use cases.
In addition to the performance evaluation, load balancing and communication costs will be included in the analysis dimensions, in order to build a structured comparison through both data mining and distributed environments criteria.
